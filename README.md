 ## Description:
 
 A simple yet complex simulation of slime molds. The true beuaty of this simulation reveals itself in the simplicity of its rules:


            üçÑ ~400 spores are released from the center

            üëÄ A spore has two sensors placed above and to the right and left of
             the direction in which its facing
             
            üç¨ The spore leaves behind a trail of pheromone as it moves

            üß≤ If one of the sensors senses the pheromone of another spore of
              the same color, it will move towards it

            üéÉ If one of the sensors senses the pheromone of another spore of a
              different color, it will move away from it

And I also added a way to draw in a pheromone that attracts the white spores and repels the blue ones.

Inspired heavily by Sebastian Lagues video on Ant and Slime Simulations.

## Controls:

Run slime.py to run simulation

             +/- ~ Add or take away amount of spores released
 
             1/2 ~ Add or take away spore speed
 
             3/4 ~ Add or take away how long the pheromone trail is behind each spore
             
             Space ~ Begin simulation
             
             R ~ Restart all spores and pheromones
             
             G ~ Activate blue culture
             
             Draw w/ mouse ~ place spore pheromone
             
             P ~ see placed pheromone
             
             B ~ Blur spores (Beta) [currently causes significant lag, would reccomend <100 spores]
